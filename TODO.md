## 🤖 AI Assistant Context

When working on this project:
1. The codebase is educational - consider learning opportunities in implementation
2. Use the monorepo structure - check both apps before creating new components
3. Maintain consistency between marketing and portal apps
4. Follow the established patterns from the premium templates
5. Consider multi-tenant architecture in all features
6. Document decisions that could teach entrepreneurial lessons

### Current Focus Areas
- Monorepo setup and configuration
- Brand identity development
- Shared component extraction
- Cross-domain authentication planning

### Known Constraints
- Marketing site must remain static export
- Portal requires dynamic features
- Different package managers per original templates
- Must support educational tracking features

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions Needed
- [ ] Choose state management solution (Context vs Zustand vs Redux)
- [ ] Decide on API structure (REST vs GraphQL)
- [ ] Select real-time communication method (WebSockets vs SSE)
- [ ] Choose testing strategy and tools

### Dependencies to Research
- [ ] Video streaming solution for lessons
- [ ] Code sandbox for interactive tutorials
- [ ] Analytics platform for user tracking
- [ ] Payment processing for program fees

### Educational Considerations
- Every feature should demonstrate a SaaS concept
- Code should be readable for learning purposes
- Include comments explaining business decisions
- Create opportunities for participants to contribute
