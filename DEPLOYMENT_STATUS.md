# Deployment Status

## Current Status (January 6, 2025)

### Marketing Site âœ…
- **URL**: https://summerbrainrot.com
- **Status**: LIVE and working
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (static export)
- **Domain**: Custom domain mapped successfully

### Portal App ðŸ”„
- **Primary URL**: https://summerbrainrot--summerbrainrot.us-central1.hosted.app
- **Custom Domain**: https://summerbrainrot.camp (needs configuration)
- **Status**: Deployed via Firebase Web App Hosting
- **Issue**: Custom domain not yet configured for Web App Hosting

## Next Steps for Portal Domain

The portal is a Next.js SSR application deployed to Firebase Web App Hosting, which handles domains differently than static Firebase Hosting. To map summerbrainrot.camp:

1. **Option 1: Use Firebase Hosting Proxy**
   - Configure a rewrite rule in Firebase Hosting to proxy to the Web App Hosting URL
   - This allows the custom domain to work with the SSR app

2. **Option 2: Configure Domain in Web App Hosting**
   - Use Firebase Console â†’ App Hosting â†’ Settings
   - Add custom domain configuration
   - Update DNS records as instructed

3. **Option 3: Export Portal as Static**
   - Convert portal to static export (would lose SSR features)
   - Deploy to regular Firebase Hosting like the marketing site

## Temporary Access

Until the custom domain is configured:
- Marketing: https://summerbrainrot.com âœ…
- Portal: https://summerbrainrot--summerbrainrot.us-central1.hosted.app âœ…

Both applications are fully functional at these URLs.
