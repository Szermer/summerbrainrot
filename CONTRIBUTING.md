# Contributing to Summer Brain Rot

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to Summer Brain Rot. This project is unique because it serves as both an educational platform and a real-world SaaS application that participants help build.

## üéØ Our Philosophy

Summer Brain Rot is built on the principle of "learning by doing." Every contribution is an opportunity to:
- Learn professional development practices
- Build real features used by actual users
- Understand the business side of software
- Develop collaboration and communication skills

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Read the Documentation**
   - Review [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for AI-assisted development context
   - Check [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for current priorities
   - Explore [docs/](./docs/) for architecture details

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/summerbrainrot.git
   cd summerbrainrot
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm run install:all
   
   # Start development servers
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Find an Issue**
   - Check issues labeled `good-first-issue`
   - Look for `help-wanted` tags
   - Review the TODO.md for upcoming features
   - Ask in discussions if you need guidance

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(portal): add progress tracking dashboard
fix(marketing): correct responsive layout on mobile
docs: update contributing guidelines
```

### 3. The Perfect Commit

Each commit should:
1. **Do one thing**: A commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Be complete**: The codebase should work after every commit
3. **Include tests**: New features need test coverage
4. **Update docs**: Documentation changes in the same commit

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Before Opening a PR:**
   - Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues
   - Run `npm run test` and ensure all pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add your changes to TODO.md if significant

2. **PR Title Format:**
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <description>
   
   Example: feat(portal): add participant onboarding flow
   ```

3. **PR Description Template:**
   ```markdown
   ## Summary

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Define explicit types (avoid `any`)
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `const` over `let`

### React/Next.js
- Functional components with hooks
- Co-locate related files (component, styles, tests)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility best practices

### File Organization
```
feature/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FeatureName.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FeatureName.test.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useFeature.ts

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature.utils.ts
```
