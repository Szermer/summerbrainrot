# Summer Brain Rot

An entrepreneurial education platform teaching young people to build SaaS businesses through hands-on development of the platform itself.

## Overview

Summer Brain Rot is a unique educational program where participants learn full-stack development, business operations, and entrepreneurship by actively building and maintaining the platform they're learning on. The project consists of two main applications: a marketing site for program information and applications, and a participant portal for authenticated users.
